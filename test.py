| **Dimension**               | **Strands (Original Open-Source SDK)**                                        | **AWS Strands (Enterprise Evolution)**                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core Philosophy**         | Model-first design with **Agent Loop** as central construct.                  | Same model-first design, but positioned as the **AWS reference SDK** for AI agents.                                                                                  |
| **Ecosystem Openness**      | Fully open â€” integrates with any LLM API, external services, or custom tools. | Still open (supports **non-AWS LLMs** via API integration and **MCP standard**), but with **first-class AWS service support**.                                       |
| **Integrations**            | Third-party APIs and services through custom connectors.                      | Native AWS integrations (Bedrock, Lambda, Step Functions, S3, DynamoDB, CloudWatch). Can also plug into **CloudTrail** for logging/compliance.                       |
| **Foundation Models**       | Multiple providers via API (OpenAI, Anthropic, HuggingFace, etc.).            | Access to **Amazon Bedrock** models (Claude, Nova, Titan, etc.) plus support for **external models** (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic directly) through LLM API integration. |
| **Observability**           | Basic logging, developer-managed monitoring.                                  | **Full observability**: OpenTelemetry (OTEL) support, CloudWatch metrics, CloudTrail integration for audit logs.                                                     |
| **Security & Guardrails**   | Developer-managed (often via wrappers like LangSmith or custom filters).      | **Built-in Responsible AI features**: Bedrock Guardrails (PII filtering, content moderation, compliance logging).                                                    |
| **Extensibility (Tools)**   | Custom Python tools and lightweight ecosystem.                                | Same extensibility + **AWS service toolkits** (S3 ops, DynamoDB queries, Bedrock agents, API Gateway calls).                                                         |
| **Deployment Model**        | Deploy anywhere (multi-cloud, on-prem, containers).                           | Optimized for AWS cloud, but still deployable outside AWS since SDK is open-source.                                                                                  |
| **Community vs Enterprise** | Community-driven, innovation-oriented.                                        | Backed by **AWS prescriptive guidance, enterprise docs, ecosystem partnerships**.                                                                                    |
