The Role of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
Standardized Data & Resource Layer
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) acts as a standardized connector for all external data and tools. Instead of hardcoding data sources in your application, you fetch them via MCP servers.

Key Benefits:

Plug-and-Play Integration: Easily swap out data sources (e.g., from local files to production APIs) without changing the core agent logic.

Governance & Security: Enforces access control, auditing, and security scopes at the data layer.

Enterprise Readiness: Makes the application modular, future-proof, and aligned with enterprise data governance standards.

This slide introduces the Model Context Protocol, or MCP—a standardized data and resource layer for our system. MCP gives us a consistent way to fetch information from sources like client profiles or market data.

It delivers three big benefits. First, it makes the system plug-and-play—we can swap demo files for live production APIs without rewriting agent code. Second, it enforces governance and security by centralizing access controls and audit logs. And third, it ensures our POC is more than a demo—it’s a scalable, enterprise-ready blueprint.
