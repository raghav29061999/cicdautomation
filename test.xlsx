A Step-by-Step Walkthrough
This diagram illustrates the primary workflow for our financial agent, from a client request to a final pitch. It demonstrates how Strands orchestrates a series of specialized agents and deterministic tools to achieve a complex outcome reliably and cost-efficiently.

1. Client Request: The process begins with a POST request from a client-facing UI or Postman, containing a {client_id}.

2. API Validation: The FastAPI route receives the request, performs initial validation, and hands it off to the main Orchestrator Agent.

3. Orchestration & Delegation: The Orchestrator Agent directs the workflow, sequentially calling the specialized agents.

4. Portfolio Monitor: This agent loads the client's data, computes risk and score, and generates a brief summary using a small LLM call. This is an example of a deterministic tool-first approach.

5. Recommender: The Recommender agent applies a set of business rules to the client's profile to generate and format tailored investment recommendations.

6. Pitch Writer: The Pitch Writer synthesizes the outputs from the previous steps into a professional, client-facing pitch, ensuring it meets all compliance and legal requirements.

7. Final Response: The API returns a JSON response containing the full client profile, portfolio summary, recommendations, and the finalized pitch.

Key Principle: The flow prioritizes deterministic tools first, LLMs second, and compliance last, ensuring that the most predictable, reliable, and cost-efficient work is done before any creative or summarization tasks are handed off to the LLM.

Now let’s walk through the happy path for our financial agent—the ideal workflow when everything goes right. It starts with a simple API call from a client app or Postman, validated at the FastAPI endpoint before touching core logic. From there, the Orchestrator Agent takes control and sequences the flow.

First, the Portfolio Monitor pulls data with deterministic tools, performs calculations, and then uses a small LLM call to summarize results in natural language. Next, the Recommender applies business rules to generate tailored investment suggestions. Finally, the Pitch Writer composes a polished, client-ready document and runs final compliance checks.

The output is returned as a single JSON response, ready for the front end to display. The key takeaway: this is a clear, predictable flow that uses the right tools for the right jobs—efficient, reliable, and cost-effective.
