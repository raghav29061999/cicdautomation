This blueprint shows how we’re preparing Strands for production on AWS. Security comes first—we’ll use Bedrock guardrails to enforce content safety policies and stop harmful inputs or outputs before they reach our system. For observability, CloudWatch will monitor performance in real time, while CloudTrail captures every API call for full auditability and compliance. On cost, we’ll apply strict tagging policies so spend is always visible and attributable to the right teams. Together, these measures ensure that Strands is not just functional, but secure, observable, and cost-efficient—laying the foundation for what could evolve into a fully managed AWS Strands service in the future.
