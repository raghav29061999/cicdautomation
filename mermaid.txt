This example demonstrates a minimal A2A (Agent-to-Agent) setup using the Python SDK.
The Test Client fetches the agentâ€™s capabilities via the Agent Card served at /.well-known/agent.json using A2ACardResolver. It then sends a message using A2AClient, either via a direct call or as a streaming request.

On the server side, the A2AStarletteApplication routes the request to DefaultRequestHandler, which uses HelloWorldAgentExecutor to invoke HelloWorldAgent. The agent simply returns the response "Hello World", which is sent back as a Message or Streamed Event.

This setup also demonstrates support for authenticated extended capabilities, where an additional skill (super_hello_world) is available for authenticated clients.
