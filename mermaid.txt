"In this demo, I'll walk you through a notebook that demonstrates how to build a long-term memory agent using the LangChain framework. The idea is to create an intelligent agent that not only responds to user queries but also retains memory of past interactions — just like a human assistant would. We're using OpenAI’s LLMs to handle conversation and embeddings, while tools like FAISS or in-memory vector stores help recall relevant context from previous chats. This memory-enhanced capability allows the agent to understand and personalize responses over time, which is particularly useful in use cases like tutoring bots, customer support agents, or personal productivity tools. Throughout the notebook, you’ll see how LangChain integrates memory modules, stream handling, and retrieval-based logic seamlessly into an LLM-powered workflow."
