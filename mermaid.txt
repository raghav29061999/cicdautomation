3 different types of memories for AI agents

1 semantic memory: Basically facts. Facts that have been learned in school for an Human same for an agent. Facts based on or about a user
2 Episodic: Experiances. THings that have been done. Past agent actions
3 Procedural: Instructions. Insticts or motor skills. Agent System prompt


Two ways of agent interacting with memory

1 Hot path - User message is hand to hand updated in memory. You have have one agent. Complicated for multiple agents
2 Background Updation - flip to hot path. No latency, now you have 2 agents to manage

in this we will build an email responder

triages the incoming agent, if the email is worth responding passes it to second agent and calender action happens
FOr this first type of memory we are giving it is Semantic Mempory. Tools for wrtting memory and for reading memory
Hot path will be used. 

then we will use Episodic memory with few shot examples and background memory
