Weâ€™re demonstrating a LangGraph-powered Currency Agent that supports:

LLM integration (via Gemini/OpenAI)

Real-time streaming updates

Multi-turn conversations when input is ambiguous

Persistent task state using A2A protocol

The goal is to show how an intelligent agent can interact like a chatbot but with robust backend orchestration, state, and streaming capabilities using A2A.
