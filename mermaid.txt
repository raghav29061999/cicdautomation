✅ Slide 6: LangChain – Long-Term Memory Agent
📌 What is it?
LangChain’s Long-Term Memory Agent is an LLM-based agent architecture designed to persist memory across interactions, allowing agents to recall past conversations, tasks, or context.

🔍 Key Features
🧠 Persistent Memory Integration
Uses LangChain’s memory modules (e.g. VectorStoreRetrieverMemory, ConversationBufferMemory) to store context over long-term sessions.

🔁 Tool-Enabled Agents
Supports tools, functions, and plugins — letting the agent recall information, browse documents, or use APIs while keeping memory intact.

🏗️ Customizable Chains & Prompts
You can define how memory is summarized, retrieved, and injected into the prompt.

💬 Multi-turn Conversational Flow
Retains historical user inputs and responses, ideal for applications like tutoring, coaching, or dialogue-based agents.

🛠️ Architecture Overview
🧱 Components:

Agent Executor: Runs the main agent logic

Tools: Search, code, math, APIs

Memory Module: Stores & retrieves conversation context
