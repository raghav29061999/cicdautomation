Test Client (test_client.py)
Fetches the agent card (using A2ACardResolver) and sends a request (using A2AClient). Supports both non-streaming and streaming modes.

Agent Definition (agent_executor.py)

HelloWorldAgent: Business logic class returning "Hello World".

HelloWorldAgentExecutor: Inherits from AgentExecutor, invokes the agent and sends response via EventQueue.

Server Entry (__main__.py)

Defines skills and agent cards (public and extended).

Starts the A2A server using A2AStarletteApplication, connecting the executor and handler (DefaultRequestHandler) with an in-memory task store.

Execution Flow:
The client sends a message → server routes it via the handler → executor runs agent logic → responds with "Hello World".
