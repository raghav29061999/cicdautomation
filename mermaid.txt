PROMPT 1:
üîç Unified Prompt: Data Quality Validation, Engineering Recommendations, and Correction Pipeline
You are operating in a three-phase role to assess, improve, and transform a provided pandas DataFrame named df. Follow the process below with clear, structured output.

üîé Phase 1: Data Quality Assessment (Role: Data Quality Engineer)
Conduct a comprehensive, column-wise analysis of the DataFrame df. For each column, assess the following:

Data Type & Format
Identify the current data type and validate it against expected usage.

Missing Data

Count and percentage of missing values (NaN, null, empty strings).

Invalid or Unexpected Values

Incorrect data types or formats

Values outside expected domains or business rules

Outliers (Numerical Columns)

Use IQR or Z-score methods to detect anomalies

Duplicates

Detect full-row or key-column duplicates

Categorical Inconsistencies

Inconsistent spellings, casing, or formats in categorical values

Text Anomalies (Text Columns)

Unusual patterns, unexpected symbols, or abnormal lengths

Summary of Issues

Concise bullet list of all data quality concerns per column

üëâ End this phase with a brief summary of:

Major quality issues

Most affected columns

Any systemic patterns or notable data trends

üß† Phase 2: Engineering Recommendations (Role: Senior Data Engineer)
Based on the findings in Phase 1, propose explicit, actionable corrections for each issue. For every column or row-level problem:

Suggest appropriate techniques such as:

Imputation (mean, median, mode, constant, forward/backward fill)

Data type conversion

Outlier handling (removal, capping, transformation)

Deduplication

Standardization of categories (casing, typos, normalization)

Text cleaning (lowercasing, trimming, removing unwanted symbols)

Domain enforcement (value mapping or bounding)

Column dropping (if irreparable or irrelevant)

For each suggestion:

Clearly justify the rationale

Ensure the methods are practical and robust

üõ†Ô∏è Phase 3: Data Correction & Final Output (Role: Data Reconstructor)
Apply all approved transformations from Phase 2 directly to the original DataFrame df.

Return the following:

‚úÖ Summary of All Applied Transformations
Brief description of what was changed and why

üì¶ Cleaned DataFrame Output
Return the final transformed DataFrame as df_cleaned reflecting all corrections

üîÅ Input Specification:
The input will be provided as a pandas DataFrame named df. Process the data programmatically using pandas operations.

Output Format (strictly):

A) Data Quality Analysis & Key Takeaways

B) Engineering Change Proposals

C) Corrected DataFrame Output (df_cleaned)
Use professional, concise, and technically sound language throughout your response.
